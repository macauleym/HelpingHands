## About

This package is a library of functions that I found to be useful in my own projects.

There are very likely many packages/libraries that already solve these problems, and much better.

However, I found that the implementations as I needed them were simple enough to try and tackle myself.
Plus I thought it would be more fun to create something myself.

If you're reading this, and you're not me, you'd likely be better off looking elsewhere for a well maintained and documented library.
